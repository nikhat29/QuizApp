## Component Breakdown
### Home.js
The landing page of the app, where users can click to begin the quiz. It provides an easy entry point for starting the quiz and may display a welcome message or call-to-action.

### Questions.js
Contains an array or object of quiz questions, options, and the correct answers. The questions can be stored in a structured format, such as:

```js
const questions = [
   {
        question: "What is the capital of France?",
        options: ["Berlin", "Madrid", "Paris", "Rome"],
        answer: "Paris",
        hints: "This city is known for its iconic landmark, the Eiffel Tower.",
        image: "../assets/images/paris.jpg" 
    },
  // Add more questions here
];
```
### Question.js
This component renders a single question along with its answer choices (radio buttons) and an optional hint. The question is passed as props to this component from the parent (usually Quiz.js).

### Result.js
After the quiz is submitted, this component calculates and displays the score. It provides feedback to the user, such as "You scored 4 out of 5 questions correctly."

### Quiz.js
Handles the quiz flow:

- Displays each question one by one.
- Keeps track of the selected answers.
- Displays the timer.
- Manages the "Next" button to move to the next question.
- Handles the "Submit" button and shows results when the quiz is completed.
- Displays hints if requested by the user.

### QuizInstructions.js
Shows a brief explanation of how to play the quiz. This component ensures that the user knows the rules and the structure of the quiz before they start.

## How It Works
### 1. Question Bank:
The list of questions is stored in the **Questions.js** file, with each question containing the text, options, and the correct answer.

### 2. Rendering Questions:
The **Quiz.js** component fetches each question from the **Questions.js** file and passes it down to Question.js for display.

### 3. Answer Validation:
The user selects an answer using radio buttons. The **Quiz.js** component keeps track of the selected answers and checks whether they are correct after submission.

### 4. Timer:
A timer (if implemented) counts down for each question. If the time runs out, the question is automatically submitted.

### 5. Final Results:
Once all questions are answered, the **Result.js** component displays the total score and a message based on the user's performance.

### 6. Hints:
If the user requests a hint, the Hint property of the current question is displayed.
